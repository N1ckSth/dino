## A bit of info about the game
There is cheatcodes with which ur game may be easier or harder <br>
GM -> immortal jutsu ( can't die ) <br>
DM -> Swap between day and night <br>
LGM -> automatic jump and duck <br>
RICH -> add 10,000 to score <br>
HSC -> highscore is 99999 <br>
SPDP -> increase speed by 2 <br><br>
So.. How to use them? The way of using is the same like in GTA Vice City. <br> You just  type it in. There is no pole for that
